# Amazon Q

Run [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) in your workspace to access Amazon's AI coding assistant. This module installs and launches Amazon Q, with support for background operation, task reporting, and custom pre/post install scripts.

```tf
module "amazon-q" {
  source   = "registry.coder.com/coder/amazon-q/coder"
  version  = "1.1.1"
  agent_id = coder_agent.example.id
  # Required: see below for how to generate
  auth_tarball = var.amazon_q_auth_tarball
}
```

## Prerequisites

- You must generate an authenticated Amazon Q tarball on another machine:
  ```sh
  cd ~/.local/share/amazon-q && tar -c . | zstd | base64 -w 0
  ```
  Paste the result into the `auth_tarball` variable.
- To run in the background, your workspace must have `screen` or `tmux` installed.

<summary><strong>How to generate the Amazon Q auth tarball (step-by-step)</strong></summary>

**1. Install and authenticate Amazon Q on your local machine:**

- Download and install Amazon Q from the [official site](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- Run `q login` and complete the authentication process in your terminal.

**2. Locate your Amazon Q config directory:**

- The config is typically stored at `~/.local/share/amazon-q`.

**3. Generate the tarball:**

- Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```sh
  cd ~/.local/share/amazon-q
  tar -c . | zstd | base64 -w 0
  ```

**4. Copy the output:**

- The command will output a long string. Copy this entire string.

**5. Paste into your Terraform variable:**

  - Assign the string to the `auth_tarball` variable in your Terraform configuration, for example:
    ```tf
    variable "amazon_q_auth_tarball" {
      type    = string
      default = "PASTE_LONG_STRING_HERE"
    }
    ```

**Note:**

- You must re-generate the tarball if you log out or re-authenticate Amazon Q on your local machine.
- This process is required for each user who wants to use Amazon Q in their workspace.

## Examples

### Run Amazon Q in the background with tmux

```tf
module "amazon-q" {
  source       = "registry.coder.com/coder/amazon-q/coder"
  version      = "1.1.1"
  agent_id     = coder_agent.example.id
  auth_tarball = var.amazon_q_auth_tarball
  use_tmux     = true
}
```

### Enable task reporting

```tf
module "amazon-q" {
  source       = "registry.coder.com/coder/amazon-q/coder"
  version      = "1.1.1"
  agent_id     = coder_agent.example.id
  auth_tarball = var.amazon_q_auth_tarball
  report_tasks = true
}
```

### Run custom scripts before/after install

```tf
module "amazon-q" {
  source              = "registry.coder.com/coder/amazon-q/coder"
  version             = "1.1.1"
  agent_id            = coder_agent.example.id
  auth_tarball        = var.amazon_q_auth_tarball
  pre_install_script  = "echo Pre-install!"
  post_install_script = "echo Post-install!"
}
```

## Notes

- Only one of `use_screen` or `use_tmux` can be true at a time.
- If neither is set, Amazon Q runs in the foreground.
